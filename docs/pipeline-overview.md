# GaussSplat Pipeline Overview

## 🎯 Mission
Create high-quality 3D reconstructions of historical battleships using synthetic multi-view images and 3D Gaussian Splatting.

## 📁 Workspace Structure

Each pipeline step has its own dedicated workspace:

### 01-image-generation/
**Purpose**: Generate consistent multi-view synthetic images of battleships
- ComfyUI workflows with ControlNet for consistency
- Reference image collection and curation
- Camera angle distribution planning
- **Output**: 200-500 synthetic views with metadata

### 02-dataset-preparation/
**Purpose**: Prepare images for 3DGS training
- Camera pose estimation (COLMAP or synthetic)
- Image selection and quality filtering
- Metadata formatting for 3DGS pipeline
- **Output**: Curated dataset with camera parameters

### 03-3dgs-training/
**Purpose**: Train 3D Gaussian Splatting models
- 3DGS optimization on local GPUs (3090/5090)
- Hyperparameter tuning for quality
- Training progress monitoring
- **Output**: Trained .ply splat files

### 04-splat-refinement/
**Purpose**: Clean and optimize gaussian splats
- Remove floating artifacts
- Optimize splat density
- Adjust colors/lighting if needed
- **Output**: Refined .ply files ready for conversion

### 05-mesh-conversion/
**Purpose**: Convert splats to traditional 3D meshes
- Splat-to-mesh algorithms (Poisson, marching cubes)
- Topology optimization
- UV mapping and texture generation
- **Output**: Standard mesh files (.obj, .fbx)

### 06-final-output/
**Purpose**: Package and document results
- Export in multiple formats
- Generate quality metrics
- Create presentation materials
- **Output**: Deliverable package
